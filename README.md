# Birdhouses
Design files for my ongoing mission to house all birbs.

Contributions welcome!

## Organization

I try to organize the designs by the general sort of tooling needed to complete them.

I forsee a flat folderspace of
- LaserCut
- 3D Printer
- Makerspace (Lastercut + 3D printer)
- Hand Tools
- Woodshop
- Etc.
